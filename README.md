# Python Project Two - Functions and Pandas Practice

## "Analyze Student Grades"

### Assignment

The objective of this assignment is to practice using the Pandas library to read and manipulate data in CSV format using Python. 

Requirements:
- read a CSV file (Grades_Short.csv) containing student grades
- calculate the average of several columns
- generate new columns based on the calculated values
- define a function to determine letter grades based on the final grade
- apply the function to generate a new column for letter grades
- save the modified data as a new CSV file

To determine the letter grade:
- Final grade greater than 90 is an "A+"
- Final grade greater than 80 is an "A"
- Final grade greater than 70 is a "B"
- Final grade greater than 60 is a "C"
- Final grade greater than 55 is a "D"
- Final grade less than or equal to 55 is an "F"
